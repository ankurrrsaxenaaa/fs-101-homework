# Day 04

## Awesome Bakery Application

- Previous Code inside the Bakery Folder of Day 03
- Refactored code inside the parent 04-day folder which is made a package

#### **What was done wrong in the assignment code:**

1. Better naming conventions should be used
2. Calculations like Customer Balance should be done outside of client perspective and not inside the Application class itself.  
3. Method responsibilities should be respective of thier classes. 
4. Code readability can be improved more in the main class - CashCalculator. Should think of the Use Case as reference.
