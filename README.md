To create this structure, do following

```
$ mkdir $(printf "%02i-day " $(seq 1 65))
```

```
$ find . -type d -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;
```

> You don't have to type `$`. It is just to signify command prompt.

Home work should be done in their respective directories. Each student should have their own Git repository based on this structure.
